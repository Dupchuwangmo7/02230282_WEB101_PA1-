# Pokémon Pokedex

This is a web application that serves as a digital encyclopedia for Pokémon. It allows users to search for Pokémon, view their details, add them to their favorites list, and view their favorites. 
This web application developed using simple html, js and css. I have used https://pokeapi.co/ to collect pokemon data.

## Features

- Search for Pokémon by name.
- View details of each Pokémon, including its image, height, weight, types, and description.
- Add Pokémon to the favorites list.
- View a list of favorite Pokémon.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
